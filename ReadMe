###### Simplified authoritative server for a network of applications

The system that we implement has three components:
1. User Server : It is a simple HTTP web server (e.g. Flask), running in port 8080, that accepts a GET HTTP requests in path: 
“/fibonacci?hostname=fibonacci.com&fs_port=K&number=X&as_ip=Y&as_port= Z”
2. Fibonacci Server : It is an HTTP web server, running in port 9090, that provides the Fibonacci value for a given sequence number X. 
It performs- Hostname Specification and Registration to Authoritative Server.
3. Authoritative Server: It is the authoritative server for US. It has two duties. First is to handle the registration requests to pair hostnames to IP,
second is to be able to respond to DNS queries from clients


Three server specific folders have been created:
  "US"-User Server
  "FS"-Fibonacci Server
  "AS"-Authoritative Server

Each folder contains the Docker file and all the files that the dockerfile needs in order to run the specific server.
